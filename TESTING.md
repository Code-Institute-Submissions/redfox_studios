Appearance of page on IOS devices.

Certain CSS elements wouldn’t translate to IoS devices, such as initial font chosen, but in particular the hero image on the page.  This was initially coded as a css background image, which upon research, seemed consistent across IoS devices according to StackOverflow and other forums.  Attempting different solutions suggested by users, it was decided not to use the css background image property.  Going back to previous projects and after trialling different methods, the Bootstrap ‘Carousel’ componenet was chosen.  Initially, this was used for multiple images, however, after testing with other users, just one image was kept on.
